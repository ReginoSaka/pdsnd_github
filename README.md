# Bikeshare Project
The Bikeshare Project is a code written in Python to analyse data of bikeshare systems for three cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The user of the code can select the city and additional filters as the month or weekday. The Code displays then some statistics regarding the usage of bikeshare systems given the specified filters.
